<Note>
  The feature is disabled by default because it requires you to provide `REPLICATE_API_KEY` in `.env` file. You can create your own API Token here
  [https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens)
</Note>

Enterprise Commerce leverages the power of AI to automatically generate captions for product images.
This feature utilizes the [Replicate API](https://replicate.com/) and the `salesforce/blip` model to analyze images and produce accurate and descriptive captions.
These captions are then used to **populate alt tags**, enhancing SEO by providing search engines with valuable information about the image content. Additionally, the captions improve user experience by **enabling image search** functionality within the platform, allowing users to quickly and easily find the products they are looking for.

To activate the AI Image Captioning feature, simply set the `IS_IMAGE_CAPTIONING_ENABLED` environment variable to true within your `.env` file. This can be done by adding the following lines:

```bash .env
IS_IMAGE_CAPTIONING_ENABLED=true
REPLICATE_API_KEY="your api key"
```

Once this variable is set, the project won't automatically start generating captions. You have to run full sync migration (only once, after enabling), learn more in [CLI > Migration page](/cli#migration)
