Enterprise Commerce provides built-in support for two powerful analytics tools: Vercel Analytics and Google Analytics. While you have the flexibility to integrate any third-party analytics solution of your choice, these two options are readily available out of the box.

## Vercel Analytics (Recommended)

Vercel Analytics is the recommended and default analytics solution in Enterprise Commerce. It offers several key advantages:

- **Privacy-friendly**: Vercel Analytics respects user privacy and does not collect personally identifiable information (PII).
- **Real-time insights**: Get instant visibility into your website's traffic and user behavior with real-time data updates.
- **Minimal performance impact**: Unlike other analytics solutions, Vercel Analytics has negligible impact on your website's performance, ensuring optimal speed and user experience.

To disable/enable Vercel Analytics, simply set the feature flag `IS_VERCEL_ANALYTICS_ENABLED` to `true` or `false` in your `.env` file:

```bash .env
IS_VERCEL_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=false
```

## Google Analytics

Enterprise Commerce also supports Google Analytics integration through the official Next.js module. While it is disabled by default, you can easily enable it by setting the feature flag `IS_GTM_ENABLED` in your `.env` file:

```bash .env
IS_GTM_ENABLED=true
```

Once enabled, the Google Analytics tracking code will be automatically added to your website, allowing you to track and analyze user behavior and traffic data.
