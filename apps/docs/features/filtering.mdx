Enterprise Commerce integrates Meilisearch as its core engine for **robust search, filtering, and recommendations**, ensuring that product data is accurately reflected and easily accessible.
Meilisearch provides a lightning-fast, typo-tolerant search experience that enhances the overall usability and efficiency of Enterprise Commerce.

## Using the Filter Builder

The `FilterBuilder` class provides a convenient way to construct complex filter expressions for Meilisearch queries. It allows you to chain methods to define various filter criteria, including comparisons, logical operators, and special operators like `EXISTS`, `IS EMPTY`, and `IS NULL`.

Here's an example of how to use the `FilterBuilder`:

```typescript
const filter = new FilterBuilder()
  .where("price", ComparisonOperators.GreaterThan, 100)
  .and()
  .group((sub) => sub.where("category", "=", "Electronics").or().where("category", "=", "Computers"))
  .build()

// This will generate the following filter expression:
// price > 100 AND (category = "Electronics" OR category = "Computers")
```

This filter expression will search for products with a price greater than 100 and belonging to either the `Electronics` or `Computers` category.

The `FilterBuilder` offers a variety of methods to construct complex search queries, allowing you to tailor your product searches to specific needs and provide a user-friendly experience.

## Reference

### Enums

#### ComparisonOperators

Represents the comparison operators that can be used in filtering conditions.

- `Equal` ( = )
- `NotEqual` ( != )
- `GreaterThan` ( > )
- `GreaterThanOrEqual` ( >= )
- `LessThan` (< )
- `LessThanOrEqual` ( \<= )
- `To` ( TO )

#### LogicalOperators

Represents the logical operators that can be used to combine filtering conditions.

- `And` (AND)
- `Or` (OR)
- `Not` (NOT)

#### SpecialOperators

Represents special operators that can be used in filtering conditions.

- `Exists` (EXISTS)
- `IsEmpty` (IS EMPTY)
- `IsNull` (IS NULL)

### Methods

#### `where(attribute: string, operator: ComparisonOperators | SpecialOperators, value?: Value): FilterBuilder`

Adds a filtering condition to the expression.

- `attribute`: The attribute to filter on.
- `operator`: The comparison or special operator to use.
- `value` (optional): The value to compare against. Can be a single value or an array of values.

Returns the `FilterBuilder` instance for chaining.

#### `to(attribute: string, min: number, max: number): FilterBuilder`

Adds a range filtering condition to the expression.

- `attribute`: The attribute to filter on.
- `min`: The minimum value of the range.
- `max`: The maximum value of the range.

Returns the `FilterBuilder` instance for chaining.

#### `exists(attribute: string): FilterBuilder`

Adds an "EXISTS" condition to the expression.

- `attribute`: The attribute to check for existence.

Returns the `FilterBuilder` instance for chaining.

#### `isEmpty(attribute: string): FilterBuilder`

Adds an "IS EMPTY" condition to the expression.

- `attribute`: The attribute to check for emptiness.

Returns the `FilterBuilder` instance for chaining.

#### `isNull(attribute: string): FilterBuilder`

Adds an "IS NULL" condition to the expression.

- `attribute`: The attribute to check for null value.

Returns the `FilterBuilder` instance for chaining.

#### `in(attribute: string, values: (string | number)[]): FilterBuilder`

Adds an "IN" condition to the expression.

- `attribute`: The attribute to filter on.
- `values`: An array of values to check against.

Returns the `FilterBuilder` instance for chaining.

#### `not(): FilterBuilder`

Adds a "NOT" operator to the expression.

Returns the `FilterBuilder` instance for chaining.

#### `and(): FilterBuilder`

Adds an "AND" operator to the expression.

Returns the `FilterBuilder` instance for chaining.

#### `or(): FilterBuilder`

Adds an "OR" operator to the expression.

Returns the `FilterBuilder` instance for chaining.

#### `group(fn: (builder: FilterBuilder) => void): FilterBuilder`

Groups a set of filtering conditions together.

- `fn`: A callback function that receives a new `FilterBuilder` instance to build the grouped conditions.

Returns the `FilterBuilder` instance for chaining.

#### `build(): string`

Builds the final filtering expression as a string.

Returns the filtering expression string.
