### Using the Filter Builder

The `FilterBuilder` class provides a convenient way to construct complex filter expressions for Meilisearch queries. It allows you to chain methods to define various filter criteria, including comparisons, logical operators, and special operators like `EXISTS`, `IS EMPTY`, and `IS NULL`.

Here's an example of how to use the `FilterBuilder`:

```typescript
const filter = new FilterBuilder()
  .where("price", ComparisonOperators.GreaterThan, 100)
  .and()
  .group((sub) => sub.where("category", "=", "Electronics").or().where("category", "=", "Computers"))
  .build()

// This will generate the following filter expression:
// price > 100 AND (category = "Electronics" OR category = "Computers")
```

This filter expression will search for products with a price greater than 100 and belonging to either the `Electronics` or `Computers` category.

The `FilterBuilder` offers a variety of methods to construct complex search queries, allowing you to tailor your product searches to specific needs and provide a user-friendly experience.
