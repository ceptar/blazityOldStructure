Enterprise Commerce leverages Meilisearch's hybrid search technology to provide a powerful and flexible Vector Search feature.
This allows users to go beyond keyword-based searches and find relevant results based on semantic meaning and conceptual understanding.

### How it works

Vector Search utilizes AI-powered embeddings to represent data points (e.g., product descriptions, customer reviews) as vectors in a high-dimensional space.
Similar data points have vectors that are close together, enabling the search engine to identify and retrieve conceptually relevant results even for complex or nuanced queries.

### Benefits

- **Improved Search Relevancy:** Vector Search significantly improves search result quality by understanding the meaning behind queries, not just the specific keywords.
- **Customizable:** Users can fine-tune the search experience by adjusting the "semantic ratio" to prioritize keyword-based or semantic search depending on their needs.
- **Future-proof:** The underlying technology is constantly evolving and improving, ensuring that Enterprise Commerce remains at the forefront of search capabilities.

### Setup

Enabling Meilisearch's Hybrid Search in your Enterprise Commerce project is a straightforward process:

1. **Navigate to your Meilisearch Cloud dashboard.**
2. **Select your project.**

6. **Click "Create new embedder".**
7. **Name your embedder "default".**
8. **Provide your OpenAI API key.**
9. **Set the "Document template".** This template determines what information from each document is sent to the AI model for embedding generation.

```
A product titled '{{doc.title}}' worth '{{doc.minPrice}}' , whose description starts with {{doc.description|truncatewords: 20}}
```

**Note:** You can customize the document template to fit your specific needs and data structure.
