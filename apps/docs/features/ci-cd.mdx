Enterprise Commerce utilizes a robust CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality, maintainability, and performance. The pipeline is powered by GitHub Actions and consists of four main actions:

## Actions

### Check

This action performs multiple checks to validate the health of the codebase. It:

- Runs unit and integration tests to ensure code reliability.
- Validates TypeScript type soundness to prevent type errors.
- Parses the project for structural integrity.
- Checks code formatting for consistency across the codebase.
- **Verifies the permissiveness of the software license in use.**

### Commitlint

This action ensures all commit messages adhere to conventional commit standards, linting messages for consistency and readability.

### Next.js Bundle Analysis

This action compares the pull request (PR) branch with the main branch in terms of application bundle size. It is particularly valuable for teams with a **performance budget**, helping maintain an optimized bundle size and preventing accidental inclusion of large dependencies.

### Playwright

The Playwright action is responsible for running end-to-end tests in a headless browser environment during the CI process, ensuring that user flows work as expected before deployment.

## Caching Strategies

**All of the above-mentioned actions employ aggressive caching strategies**, which allow the actions to complete in approximately 1 minute if there are no changes to the `yarn.lock` file. The caching efficiency is enhanced by utilizing TurboRepo's remote caching functionality, which can be found at [TurboRepo Remote Caching Documentation](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching).

The adoption of these caching techniques significantly reduces the CI run time, optimizing the development cycle and resource usage.
