Enterprise Commerce utilizes the `@vercel/og` library to generate dynamic Open Graph (OG) images for enhanced social media sharing.
This feature allows you to create visually appealing and informative social media cards that automatically update based on product information and other relevant data.

By leveraging a `style` object or Tailwind CSS, you have complete control over the design, data and appearance of your OG images. This ensures consistent branding and a professional presentation across all social media platforms.

**Especially important for Twitter since the engagement rate of Tweets that embed a card is 40% higher.**
