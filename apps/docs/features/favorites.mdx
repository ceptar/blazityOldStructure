The Favorites feature allows users to "like" products and save them for later viewing or purchase. This functionality is accessible without requiring user accounts or logins.

**Technical Implementation:**

Favorites data is stored exclusively within the user's browser, specifically in `localStorage`. This means that:

- **No server-side storage or user accounts are involved.**
- **Favorites data is specific to the browser and device used.**
- **Data is not shared across devices or browsers.**

**Note:** Due to the reliance on `localStorage`, clearing browser data or using a different browser will result in the loss of saved favorites.
