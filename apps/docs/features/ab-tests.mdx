Enterprise Commerce empowers you to optimize your storefront and user experience through its built-in A/B testing system. This system allows you to experiment with different website elements and features **without compromising performance or causing layout shifts.**

### How it Works

The A/B testing system utilizes a mathematical approach to assign users to different test buckets. This ensures a fair and unbiased distribution, allowing you to accurately compare the performance of different variations.

Users are assigned to a specific bucket based on a random number generator and percentage allocation calculations. This ensures that each user consistently sees the same variation throughout their session, providing a controlled testing environment.

### Configuration

By default, A/B testing is enabled only on the homepage to showcase the feature. To activate it on other pages, follow these steps:

1. Edit the `ROUTES` constant in the `middleware.ts` file.

```tsx middleware.ts
const ROUTES: Record<string, Route | undefined> = {
  "/": {
    page: "/home",
    cookie: "bucket-home",
    buckets: BUCKETS.HOME,
  },
}
```

2. Add an entry for the desired route, specifying the page (pathname), cookie name, and available buckets.
3. Modify the corresponding page component to accept a `[bucket]` parameter in its route (e.g., `app/category/[slug]/[bucket]/page.tsx`).

### Example Usage

A/B testing allows you to display different components or even entire pages to different user groups. This enables you to test various versions of elements like buttons, banners, or product descriptions to identify the most effective design and messaging.

Here's an example of how to implement A/B testing for a hero section title:

```tsx
export default function Homepage({ params: { bucket } }) {
  const heroTitles = {
    a: "Your daily trendsetting deals",
    b: "Your daily top deals",
  }

  return <HeroSection title={heroTitles[bucket]} />
}
```

In this example, users assigned to bucket "a" will see the title "Your daily trendsetting deals," while users in bucket "b" will see "Your daily top deals." By tracking user engagement and conversion rates for each variation, you can determine which title performs better and implement the optimal version for your storefront.
