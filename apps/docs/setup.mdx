To streamline the setup process, we will first list all necessary environment variables required for configuration. Subsequently, we'll provide detailed instructions on how to obtain each of these variables.

Below is the list of environment variables that you'll need to configure in your `.env` file for the proper setup of your enterprise commerce system:

### 4. Setting Up Meilisearch

Meilisearch is a powerful, fast, open-source search engine. There are two main ways to host Meilisearch: on-premise (self-hosting on dedicated servers or cloud providers) and using Meilisearch Cloud. For the purposes of this guide, we will focus on the recommended approach, which is using Meilisearch Cloud.

To get started with Meilisearch Cloud, navigate to the Meilisearch Cloud platform and [log in](https://cloud.meilisearch.com/).

- Create a new project within the platform.
- Create an index called `products`. If you wish to use different index name you will also have to make a change in the codebase.
- After your project is set up, proceed to the "Settings" tab of your Meilisearch Cloud project.
- Locate and copy the `Master key`. This key should be securely stored in your .env file under the `MEILISEARCH_MASTER_KEY` variable.
- Copy the Meilisearch URL and place it in your .env file under `MEILISEARCH_HOST`. **Ensure you do not include a trailing slash at the end of the URL.**

## Setup your development

Learn how to update your docs locally and and deploy them to the public.

### Edit and preview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone your docs locally">
    During the onboarding process, we created a repository on your Github with your docs content. You can find this repository on our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
    To clone the repository locally, follow these [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) in your terminal.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview changes">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a command line interface to render these changes locally. 1. Install the [Mintlify
    CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the documentation changes locally with this command: ``` npm i -g mintlify ``` 2. Run the following command at the root
    of your documentation (where `mint.json` is): ``` mintlify dev ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
  Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on your
  [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash of the repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
  [Commit and push your changes to Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push) for your changes to update in your
  docs site. If you push and don't see that the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually update your docs through our
  [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
